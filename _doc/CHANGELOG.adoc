[#v0_6_0]
== gotp v0.6.0 (2024-06-22)

[#v0_6_0__new_features]
=== New features

all: implement command "export"::
+
--
The "export" command export all issuers to file or standard output,

    $ gotp export <FORMAT> [FILE]

List of known supported FORMAT is: uri.
If FILE is not defined it will print to standard output.
The list of exported issuers are printed in order of its label.
--

[#v0_6_0__bug_fixes]
=== Bug fix

Fix "gen" command due to lower case secret::
+
Sometimes, provider provide base32 of secret in lowercase.
But, to decode it, all of the characters must be in upper case otherwise it
will be failed.


[#v0_5_0]
== gotp v0.5.0 (2024-02-08)

[#v0_5_0__breaking_changes]
=== Breaking changes

all: make the path to private key static::
+
Instead of prompting user, make the private key static, located at
"$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/gotp/gotp.key".
If the key exist, the issuer will be encrypted.


[#v0_5_0__enhancements]
=== Enhancements

all: ask for passphrase when removing or renaming label::
+
--
Even though "rename" command does not read the encrypted secret, as long as
the private key is in use, it should ask for passphrase.

The remove operation allow only the one that know the private key can
modify the issuer.
--

_sys: fix the bash completion installation directory::
+
In POSIX system, the correct installation for bash completion
script should be /usr/share/bash-completion not under /etc
directory.


[#v0_4_0]
== gotp v0.4.0 (2023-11-11)

[#v0_4_0__new_features]
=== New features

all: implement command "get"::
+
The "get" command get and print the issuer by its LABEL.
This will print the issuer secret, unencrypted.

[#v0_4_0__enhancements]
=== Enhancements

all: unfold private key path before reading::
+
By unfolding, user can set the path to private key using "~" that points
to their home.
This make the key can works across home directory, in case user have
multiple homes (Linux and macOS have different home path and maybe
user name, but both can use "~" as substitution for $HOME)

Makefile: add task to install and uninstall gotp in macOS::


[#v0_3_1]
== gotp v0.3.1 (2023-05-25)

[#v0_3_1__bug_fix]
===  Bug fix

all: load private key only when needed::
+
--
In case the configuration use private key with passphrase, the bash
completion will hang due to the command ask for passphrase.

This changes fix this issue by loading private key only when doing add,
generate, import, or remote-private-key.
--

== gotp v0.3.0 (2023-05-17)

[#v0_3_0__new_features]
=== New features

all: add command to remove the private key::
+
The remove-private-key decrypt the issuer's value back using previous
private key and store it back to file as plain text.

all: add command to set private key::

The set-private-key command encrypt the issuer's value (hash:secret...)
in the file using private key.
